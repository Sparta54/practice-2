# Write an if-else statement that determines if a string (like "apple") is less than 5 characters long. 
# Use the function len() to determine the length of the string. 
# Print an output message that tells you the length of the string if the string is less than 5 characters long. 
# If the string is longer than 5 characters, print out something that says "string is too long" or something like that.


# Put len() code here

# For later... (Ignore for now)

# Use the following for your code
fruit_basket = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "apple", "lemon", "apple", "apple"]
search_target = "apple"
apple_count = 0

# Write a Python script that will count the number of apples in the fruit basket.
# Use a for loop to loop through each element of the fruit basket list, compare the element to the search target, and if the element is an "apple", increase the apple count by 1.
