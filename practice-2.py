# Write an if-else statement that determines if a string (like "apple") is less than 5 characters long. 
# Use the function len() to determine the length of the string. 
# Print an output message that tells you the length of the string if the string is less than 5 characters long. 
# If the string is longer than 5 characters, print out something that says "string is too long" or something like that.


# [JONATHAN] Delete my notes here when you update it.

input_string = 'apples'
len(input_string)

if len(input_string) < 5:   # [JONATHAN] Add len() around the input_string. Remove the word 'characters'. Add a colon (:) at the end of this line.
    print('string is too short')  # [JONATHAN] This should be indented 
else:
    print('String is too long')






# [JONATHAN] Excellent! Now, write an if statement that says:
if (string is less than 5 characters):
